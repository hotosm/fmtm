# 📖 History

## How was Field-TM born?

It started as Ivan's idea to build Field-TM (Ivan Gayton is Senior Humanitarian
Advisor at Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team) which then became a collaborative
project with the efforts of Ivan, Rob Savoye who is Senior Technical Lead at
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and many other members from HOT as well as
volunteers interested in the project.

HOT uses ODK heavily, but most of the data never makes it into OSM because all
the data processing is manual and slow, so it doesn't get done.

Ivan Gayton (Senior Humanitarian Advisor at Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team)
heard about what Rob was working on and goes "That's the missing piece I
needed!". He'd been wanting to build Field-TM for years, but lacked the ability to
process the data.

A [webinar][1] then took place in September 2022
that showcased the high interest from the community and the need for
collaborative field mapping that really kicked off the starting point for
building the Field Tasking Manager.

## A project to provide tools for Open Mapping campaigns

The Field Tasking Manager (Field-TM) is a project that aims to provide tools
for coordinating field mapping activities in Open Mapping campaigns. While
there are existing field mapping applications, there is a lack of efficient
tools to coordinate these activities. The Field-TM builds on the HOT Tasking
Manager and other mapping applications to provide a more streamlined and
organized process for completing mapping tasks.

Currently, it is possible to implement a Field Tasking Manager workflow
using existing tools, but it requires significant effort and can be challenging.

The Field-TM project is developing automation features to address these challenges
and make the process more accessible to users.

By providing a centralized platform for organizing and managing mapping tasks,
assigning them to specific users, and tracking their progress, Field-TM aims to
simplify the coordination of mapping activities. The tool also provides
analytics and reporting features, allowing users to gain insights into mapping
campaigns and adjust their strategies accordingly.

## How to contribute

The Field-TM project is open source and community-driven, welcoming contributions
from designers, user testers, and both front-end and back-end developers. If
you're interested in getting involved, please see our
[contributor guidelines][4]
for more information. We welcome questions and feedback, so don't hesitate
to reach out to us. 👍🎉

## Using ODK's Select From Map feature

ODK's Select From Map feature is a useful tool for field mappers to
collect data in a well-structured questionnaire format. The tool was
incorporated into ODK in mid-2022 and allows mappers to select an object from a
map, view its existing attributes, and fill out a form with new information
and attributes.

To prepare map files for ODK, inspiration is taken from the HOT Tasking Manager,
which allows remote mappers to choose well-defined small "task" areas, ensuring
full coverage of the project area and no unintended duplication of tasks. For
example, a mapper can approach a building, select that building from a map
view within ODK on their mobile phone, and add the opening hours, number of
floors, construction material, or any number of useful attributes in a
well-structured questionnaire format

To prepare the appropriate map files for ODK, we are taking our inspiration from
the [HOT Tasking Manager][5], which allows remote
mappers to choose well-defined small "task" areas, ensuring full coverage
of the project area and no unintended duplication of tasks.
