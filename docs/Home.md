# Welcome To The Field Mapping Wiki!!

**What is ONE thing all the greatest solutions out there have in common?**

They never forget the people they are building for (^^)

So who are we building field mapping solutions for? In short, we build solutions for:

- The **Mapping Coordinator/Field Mapping Manager** (The person who coordinates field mapping)
- The **Field Mapper** (The person who collects data)
- The **Validator** (The person who checks the quality of data collected)

Below is an overview of the user flow of the **Field Mapper**, the **Mapping Coordinator / Field Mapping Manager** and the **Validator**.

[Click here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPX4XLcI=/?moveToWidget=3458764534814634286&cot=14) to see an overview of who you are building for, which actions they take and some ideas for solutions!

# The Field Mapper (The person who collects data)
The **Field Mapper** surveys locations and collects data from them. The basic work flow that a **Field Mapper** has to consider is as follows:
1. Find a phone that:
    - Works well with the app
    - Has mobile data or an internet plan
2. Install all necessary apps on the phone
3. Access the **OSM** registration site and register
4. Follow the tutorial and choose a campaign
5. Select a task from the campaign
6. Launch the map app which allows you to see the moving map of the points that you are now responsible for.
7. Complete each point within the task, making sure to answer the questions in the form for each one.
8. Send the data of each point until the task is complete
9. Once the task is complete, signal that your task is finished. This lets the **Validator** know that they can check the quality of your data

# The Field Mapping Manager (The person who coordinates field mapping)
The **Field Mapping Manager** is tasked with coordinating all mapping activities, ensuring that **Field Mappers** are safe and qualified to work, as well as monitoring data quality. The **Field Mapping Manager** has to consider 3 main activities:

1. **Pre-field data collection activities**
    - Setting up and testing tools
    - Creating a form
    - Training field mappers (making sure that they understand the form and how to fill it)
    - Creating an area of interest within the location to be mapped
    
2. **Data collection activities**
    - Preparing daily, weekly and monthly activity plans
    - Deploying team (assessing safety and qualifications of mappers)
    - Data quality monitoring
    
3. **Post-field data collection activities**
    - Daily review of data
    - Giving and recieving team feedback
    - Updating tools and methodoligies

# The Validator (The person who checks the quality of data collected)

![Screenshot 2022-10-20 at 12 14 16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107098623/196922048-c156b8ed-7f1a-404b-a636-fcfca2c0b328.png)

The **Validator** does the following tasks to ensure that quality data is collected and uploaded to **OSM**:
- Logs into task manager
- Checks how many tasks need validation
- Checks tasks for errors 
- Stops mappers that make mistakes and explains how they can fix their errors
- Lowers supervision on good mappers in order to spend more time on those who are stuggling
- Uploads high quality data to **OSM** and marks completed tasks as **done**

Some of the pain points and struggles faced by the **Validator** include:
- Lack of validators (the **Validator** is often the same person as the **Field Mapping Manager**)
- Many areas of the world are still unmapped on online commercial maps
- The quality of maps needs to improve
- The more developers complicate tools, the more they reduce the usefulness of the tools
